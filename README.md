To use each script look at the list of distributions below and select which one you are using, then copy the command into a terminal session.

The point of this script is to install essential third party repositories and software to make the distribution you are using easier to use. These things include; Third party codecs, Media players, propriatery repositories and non-free software.

All the scripts can be donwloaded and edited to your liking, you may also create your own install scripts based on mine to publish yourself.
